# LearnStem
For a fun project, a couple classmates & I coded an Alexa Skill in Python called Learn Stem. Our application intends to help younger kids practice STEM-related topics in an engaging way. This project was a great opportunity for us to learn Python and the nuances of Alexa development.

While the skill is functioning, we would still like to make improvements, including:
- Exhaust possible mistakes or inconsistencies in dialogue that could occur, then add logic to remedy bugs
- Make the answer validation feature more robust 
- Integrate API instead of manually inputting questions
- Resolve issues preventing full APL usage, then customize UI (add buttons, photos accompanying quesitons
